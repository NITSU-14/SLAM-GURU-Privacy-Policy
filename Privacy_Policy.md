# Privacy Policy for Slam Guru Discord Bot

**Last Updated:** September 7, 2025

This document outlines the types of data Slam Guru ("the bot") collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding your data. Your use of the bot implies consent to this policy.

### 1. Data We Collect

To provide a functional and personalized game experience, the bot stores the following data:

* **Discord User ID:** Your unique Discord ID is stored as the primary identifier for your game profile.
* **Game-Specific Data:** This includes your coin balance, card collection, cooldown timestamps, and game statistics (like XP, battle records, etc.).
* **Server and Channel IDs:** We may use server and channel IDs to provide context-aware features and commands, but we do not store them permanently in user profiles.

For display purposes (e.g., on leaderboards or in profiles), the bot will fetch your current **Discord Username and Avatar** via the Discord API. This information is retrieved in real-time and is not stored in our database.

### 2. Data We Do Not Collect

We do **not** collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your real name, age, gender, email address, or any content from your messages that is not directly related to a command's function (like the `/atlas` game).

### 3. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used exclusively for the following purposes:

* **Core Bot Functionality:** To save your game progress, manage your inventory, and ensure all game-related commands work correctly.
* **Gameplay Features:** To display your information on profiles and leaderboards.
* **Debugging and Support:** To identify and resolve technical issues or provide user support.

### 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with any third parties. Your data is only accessible to the bot's developers for the purposes of maintenance and support.

### 5. Data Retention & Deletion

Your game data is stored as long as you are using the bot. You have the right to request the complete deletion of your personal data at any time. To do so, please join our official support server and contact a developer. Data deletion requests are typically processed within 7 days.

### 6. Policy Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Significant changes will be announced in our support server. Continued use of the bot after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.

### 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this policy or your data, please contact us in the Slam Guru support server.
